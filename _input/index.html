    I&#x27;m Senior Technical Director at
    <a href="https://basecampcodingacademy.org/">Base Camp Coding Academy</a>.
    We teach high school graduates near Water Valley, MS how to be full-stack
    software developers in a year. Every student attends with full scholarship
    (with free lunch and gas cards!) thanks to our
    <a href="https://basecampcodingacademy.org/sponsors">wonderful sponsors</a>.
    All 11 graduates of our inaugural class graduated with employment offers
    from nearby software development companies, and the future looks brighter
    every day! Local documentary filmmaker,
    <a href="https://www.joeyork.com/">Joe York</a>, made a great
    <a href="https://youtu.be/D_Z1dhiPPxE">short film</a> about our first year.

        <h4>As a Software Developer...</h4>
        At Collegiate Tutoring I built the API to support their two sided
        marketplace between tutors and students using
        <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/"
          >Django REST Framework</a
        >. The platform has an emphasis on supporting Greek organizations, so
        there was some fun code involved with splitting expenses between
        students, potentially their organization&#x27;s budget, and collecting a
        platform fee. Payments were processed using
        <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>. We used
        <a href="http://www.celeryproject.org/">celery</a> and
        <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> for background jobs.

        <h4>As an Educator...</h4>
        I was super excited to work with one of my graduates from Base Camp
        Coding Academy. One of my past graduates was brought on to develop an
        SMS reminder system using
        <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>, and it was a lot of fun to
        get to work with them outside of the classroom.

        At Myra Mirrors I was responsible for

        development on the company&#x27;s mobile companion application and
        <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> development on the smart
        mirror itself. I also helped prepare and demonstrate our product at
        <a href="https://www.ces.tech">CES</a> this year.

        <h4>As an Educator...</h4>
        I didn&#x27;t have any explicit responsibilities or opportunities as an
        educator at Myra, but I tried to bring my experience as a teacher to the
        table when interacting with colleagues. Good coworkers learn from each
        other as they work together; so I tried to be mindful of learning from
        the people around me.

        <h4>As a Software Developer...</h4>
        I briefly worked at a financial technology company called FNC. I worked
        on a team that built infrastructure services in
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29"
          >C#</a
        >
        with <a href="https://www.asp.net/">ASP.Net</a>. When I could get away
        with it, I would try any to write any tools or tests I needed in
        <a href="http://fsharp.org/">F#</a>. One of my favorites was a hackathon
        project where I implemented a small domain specific language for a rules
        engine in F#.

      <section>
        <h4>As an Educator...</h4>
        Management at FNC was very supportive and allowed me to teach some
        internal courses on functional programming in F#. I also led a small
        book club that starting working through
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-Scala-Paul-Chiusano/dp/1617290653"
          >Functional Programming in Scala</a
        >. We didn&#x27;t finish the book before I left the company, but it was
        a fun group.

        <h4>As a Software Developer...</h4>
        In college I caught functional programming fever. It started out as
        googling &quot;functional programming in Python&quot; every few days,
        but eventually I grew into using functional programming languages like
        <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>,
        <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>, and
        <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>.

        <h4>As an Educator...</h4>
        As an undergrad I noticed that the introductory programming labs were
        understaffed, so I volunteered to help out. Eventually I ended up with a
        teaching assistantship where I tried to contribute my voice to the
        design of the introductory computer science curriculum at MSU.
